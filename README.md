# Kill the King

This repository is the word-of-god most updated version of Kill the King. I don't recommend referencing this project for educational purposes unless you're trying to figure out how a specific mechanic works; some of the code is pretty messy, particularly in terms of organization, and it is not well-commented. The resource pack is not currently included in this repo, but I do include it in releases.
